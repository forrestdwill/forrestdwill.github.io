     <h2>BIO</h2>
     <p> Other than being a dog owner, I am a married coffee drinker and artist who spends most of my time either behind the bar making drinks or gracing the lovely halls of Towson University. My plan is either to open up my own brewery/distillery or brand your identity as a graphic designer! I love design whether it be architectural, interior or print, I have a strong passion for putting art in its proper place.</p>

     <h3>Additional info</h3>
     <p> This web page also includes another designers work that I am also supposed to share, more or less a webpage that I find fascinating. The artists name is Lorenzo Verzini, yes he is italian, and yes I think his website rocks. The page is easy to navigate and stylistically very pleasing. The colors he uses works very well and the simplicity of the webpage is very important. Lorenzo seems to follow the keep it simple stupid mindset, which I always enjoy and think works very well. I can't wait to attempt to build something like this someday. Below is a link to his webpage as well as some great screen shots of his work.</p>
